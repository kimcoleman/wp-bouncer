== Description ==

WP Bouncer restricts the number of simultaneous logins for your WordPress users. It aims to deter people from sharing their login credentials for your site, which is especially important for a paid membership site.

= How it Works =
* The plugin stores a random `FAKESESSID` for each user when they log in.
* If a user is logged in, on each page load (init hook), WP Bouncer checks if the `FAKESESSID` stored in the userâ€™s cookies is the same as the last login stored in a transient (`fakesessid_user_login`).
* If the two values do no match, WP Bouncer logs the user out and redirects them to a warning message.
* If the WP_BOUNCER_HEARTBEAT_CHECK is defined to true, JavaScript will be loaded to bounce users when a new user logs in with the same login. This is useful for sites with page caching.

Admin accounts (specifically users with the "manage_options" capability) are excluded from bounces.

= Allow a Specific Number of Active Sessions =
By default, WP Bouncer only allows one session per user. But, you can use this plugin to offer bulk memberships to corporate, education, or other group-type customers via a shared login.

Use the `wp_bouncer_number_simultaneous_logins` filter to allow a defined number of active "sessions".

= Example Use Case =
* User A logs in as "user". Their `FAKESESSID`, say "SESSION_A" is stored in a WordPress option.
* User B logs in as "user". Their `FAKESESSID`, say "SESSION_B" is overwrites the stored WordPress option.
* User A tries to load a page on your site, WP Bouncer catches them and logs them out, redirecting them to the warning message.
* User B can browse around the site as normal... unless...
* User A logs in again as "user". Their `FAKESESSID`, "SESSION_A_v2" is stored in the WordPress option.
* Now user B would be logged out if they load another page.

= Hooks and Filters =
* `wp_bouncer_ignore_admins` filter: if returning false even admins will be bounced.
* `wp_bouncer_redirect_url` filter: can be used to change the URL redirected to after being bounced.
* `wp_bouncer_number_simultaneous_logins` filter: can be set to limit logins to a number other than 1. 0 means unlimited logins.
* `wp_bouncer_login_flag`: runs right before bouncing (can be used to potentially stop the bouncing).
* `wp_bouncer_session_ids` hook: used to filter session ids when saving them. Passes $session_ids, $old_session_ids (before any were removed/bounced), and the current user's ID as parameters.
* `wp_bouncer_session_length` hook: used to filter how long the session ids transients are set. This way, you can time the transients to expire at a specific time of day. Note that the transient is saved on every page load, so if you set it to 5 minutes, it's going to push it out 5 minutes on every page load. You should try to set it to (the number of seconds until midnight) or something like that.

= Future Improvements =
* Settings page to choose where users are taken after being bounced.
* Keep track of how many bounces there are and lock the account down if there are so many in a small time frame.

== Installation ==

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.

1. Upload `wp-bouncer` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. To enable JavaScript checks, add the following code to your wp-config.php:

define( 'WP_BOUNCER_HEARTBEAT_CHECK', true );

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I need something strong to keep people from sharing accounts. =
We've found that using a 2-Factor-Authentication scheme on your site is a good way to keep people from sharing accounts. When we tried to design an advanced version of WP-Bouncer, it was basically 2FA. So try that.

== Screenshots ==

1. Warning message shown when a user is bounced.

== Changelog ==
= 1.5 - 2021-06-02 =
* ENHANCEMENT: Removed the login-warning.php file. Instead, we redirect to the wp-login.php page and show a message.
* BUG FIX: Adjusted URLs to be https and adjusted meta tags to be be noindex/nofollow.

= 1.4.1 - 2020-01-01 =
* BUG FIX: Fixed issue where users were not redirected to the warning page when logged out.

= 1.4 - 2019-01-16 =
* BUG FIX: Fixed issue with how things were stored in transients. (Thanks, zackdn on GitHub)
* FEATURE: Added JavaScript to bounce users in case the PHP bouncer is not running (e.g. when using page caching). To enable this, add `define( 'WP_BOUNCER_HEARTBEAT_CHECK', true );` to your wp-config.php (without the backticks).

= 1.3.1 =
* Fixed a typo.
* Tested up to WP 4.8

= 1.3 =
* Added a user action link (hover over a user on the users.php page in the dashboard) to reset all sessions for a user.
* Added wp_bouncer_session_ids hook to filter session ids when saving them. Passes $session_ids, $old_session_ids (before any were removed/bounced), and the current user's ID as parameters.
* Added wp_bouncer_session_length hook to filter how long the session ids transients are set. This way, you can time the transients to expire at a specific time of day. Note that the transient is saved on every page load, so if you set it to 5 minutes, it's going to push it out 5 minutes on every page load. You should try to set it to (the number of seconds until midnight) or something like that.

= 1.2 =
* Fixed some typos in the variables used to generate the session ids.
* The fakesessid_{user_login} transients are now storing arrays of session ids. This allowed for multiple (but limited) sessions per user if wanted.
* Added wp_bouncer_ignore_admins filter, if returning false even admins will be bounced.
* Added wp_bouncer_redirect_url filter, which can be used to change the URL redirected to after being bounced.
* Added wp_bouncer_number_simultaneous_logins filter, which can be set to limit logins to a number other than 1. 0 means unlimited logins.
* Added wp_bouncer_login_flag in case you want to hook in and do something right before bouncing (or potentially stop the bouncing).

= 1.1 =
* Admin accounts (specifically users with "manage_options" capability) are excluded from bounces. This will eventually be a setting once we setup a settings page.
* Readme changes.

= 1.0.1 =
* Fixed bug with how transients were being set and get.
* Removed code in track_login that made sure you were logging in from login page. This will allow wp bouncer to kick in when logging in via wp_signon, etc.
* Moved redirect url to a class property. Will eventually add a settings page for this and any other setting/configuration value.

= 1.0 =
* First release!

== Upgrade Notice ==

= 1.1 =
* Admin accounts (specifically users with "manage_options" capability) are excluded from bounces. This will eventually be a setting once we setup a settings page.
